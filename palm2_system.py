"""PaLM 2 Restaurant Recommender System

This is a library that interfaces with the Google Maps API and the PaLM 2 API
to create the backend for the restaurant recommender system.

As soon as the user logs into the app, the Google Maps API extracts all nearby
restaurants and loads it into the context of the PaLM 2 LLM. The user then
provides prompts which are fed into the PaLM 2 LLM, and then this library
extracts the response from the model to give back to the front end and then the
user.

The way to use this API is to do the following:
    1) While setting up the app, run the following command:

            response = palm2_system.setup()

       This setup command sets up the 'response' object, which will hold all of
       the conversation between the user and PaLM 2

    2) Each time the user gives a prompt, run the following command:

            answer = palm2_system.chat(response, [whatever the prompt is])

       This command returns the answer from PaLM 2 but at the same time updates
       the 'response' object with the new prompt and answer. To be clear, the
       'answer' variable contains the most recent text response from PaLM 2.
       The string stored in this variable should be the one displayed to the
       user. And this 'response' object is the same response object you defined
       in the setup.
